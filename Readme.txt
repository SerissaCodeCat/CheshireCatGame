BRIEF IDEAS, VERY UP FOR CHANGE!!

Level 1, Fae Forrest, Chesenay and her brothers and sisters learning tricks and challenging 
eachother to races and stealing treats. Sidh are protecting them as they learn.

humans or other "wild Fae", introduce a food mechanic for stamina regeneration?

Level 3, Streets of Victorian London, mostly stealth based gameplay focusing around the lamp lights.

Level 4, first mission with the Rippers to get a small coven of witches to come back quietly,
major narative plot as Chesenay find out that even when the supernaturals surrender peacefully
they are still tortured for further information. 

level 5, Chase Dolphus through London, Dolphus has taken a person that Chesenay has formed an 
attachement to? possibly finish the level with a timing platform puzzle hopping through the gears 
in the london clock tower?
